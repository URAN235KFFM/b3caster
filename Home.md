# b3caster

b3caster is a podcast server based on [dircaster](http://www.dircaster.org/) and [bashpodder](http://lincgeek.org/bashpodder).
I was inspired by [Farhad'd](http://slexy.org/view/s2MxMjFIYN) approach as featured in a [Linux Action Show](http://www.jupiterbroadcasting.com/) episode about bash scripts.

The name b3caster come from podcast and the use of a [Excito](http://www.excito.com/) b3 server.
