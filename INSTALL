This solution was build and tested using dircaster in a Excito b3 server.


1. Download Dircaster from http://www.dircaster.org/downloads.html

2. Set up Dircaster in your web server (ex: /www/b3caster/)

3. Set up a folder for the scripts (downloader.sh, caster_zones.sh, etc.)

4. Make the proper changes in all the .sh and .conf files

5. Add b3caster.sh to cron or run it manually
